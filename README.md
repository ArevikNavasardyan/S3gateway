# S3gateway

This C++ program establishes a gateway to integrate a Lustre file system (POSIX-compliant) with MinIO, an S3-compatible object storage system. The gateway enables seamless translation of file operations between Lustre and MinIO while incorporating file lock management for concurrent access control.
